/**
 * MeaningDimensionValueRecipe - DimensionValue specialization for meaning
 *
 * Links an object to its position in semantic space via MeaningNode.
 * Follows the same pattern as TimeDimensionValue.
 *
 * Versioning: Unversioned (object→meaning mapping is deterministic)
 * Reverse Maps:
 *   - Dimension → MeaningDimensionValue
 *   - MeaningNode → MeaningDimensionValue
